					<p>When body is stressed, cortisol levels rise: increasing blood pressure and excess calories in the midsection. Scientific evidence shows that infrared saunas help maintain healthy levels of cortisol.<br>
                       With regular infrared sauna use, it has clinically shown to reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.<br>
                       With the inclusion of Sound Acoustic Vibrational Therapy, you won’t be able to find a more effective combination infrared sauna heat and musical massage to induce deep relaxation and tension relief.
                       Relaxation is more important to health than most people realize. The American Institute of Stress - estimates that 75 to 90% of all visits to primary care physicians are for stress-related problems. Long-term stress is the cause of countless physiological effects on the body, including increased blood pressure, weight gain and weakening of the immune system.
                       According to New York Times best-selling author and fitness expert Jorge Cruise – as well as many other health professionals – the more stressed you are, the more cortisol your body produces. Cortisol is a “fight or flight” hormone made in the adrenal glands that raises heart rate and blood pressure and leads to the deposit of excess calories in the midsection.
                       Scientific evidence also shows that infrared sauna therapy helps the body maintain healthy levels of cortisol.<br>
                       While cortisol levels stay the same or rise slightly during a sauna therapy session, they drop immediately afterward. In fact, Sunlighten saunas have been clinically shown to reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with regular use.
                       Through the use of cutting-edge Solocarbon® heating technology, Sunlighten saunas deliver the most therapeutic infrared sauna heat per square inch (up to 99% efficient), so that you can be enveloped in soothing warmth to help you relieve stress, ease your muscles and fully relax. And with the inclusion of our exclusive SO Sound acoustic vibrational therapy, you won’t be able to find a more effective combination infrared sauna heat and musical massage to induce deep relaxation and tension relief.
                       Sunlighten saunas are guaranteed to help you relax in natural comfort with an invigorating deep tissue sweat that will have you feeling fully refreshed after every sauna session.

						<p>
                        One study found that, at least in mice, chronic stress impaired the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain involved in abstract thought,
                        cognitive analysis and detecting the appropriate behavior for a given situation. Previous research in mice also showed that shorter bursts
                        of stress impaired the centers of the brain involved in memory and learning, and left the mice struggling to remember how to find their way
                        through a maze. 
                        A number of studies have also found that stress increases the amount of certain proteins in the brain that have been linked to Alzheimer’s,
                        possibly accelerating the development of the disease.

						<p>A 2007 University of Cambridge study found that people who coped the best with stressful life events had a 24 percent lower risk of stroke.
                        It may be partly due to the fact that people who handle stress well often are healthy in other ways, like exercising regularly and not smoking. 
                        A 2011 study examined the specific effects of work-related stress, and found that among middle- and upper-class men, psychological stress caused 
                        about 10 percent of strokes.</p>

					<div class="grid_3"><p<h2>Relaxing helps you make better decisions. </h2></p>
						<p>It’s no surprise that when you’re under stress, you might not always be thinking so clearly. But a 2012 study found that stress seems to actually
                         change how we weigh risks and rewards, and can cloud our judgment when we are faced with important decisions. focus on the positive, and may ignore 
                         the cons of the decision they’re about to make,  
                         one of the study’s authors, Mara Mather Ph.D., a professor of gerontology and psychology at the University of Southern California, said in a statement. 
                         That may also help explain why alcoholics crave a drink more when they’re under pressure. “The compulsion to get that reward comes stronger and they’re
                         less able to resist it,” Mather said.</p>
