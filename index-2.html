							<h4>Nail Polish</h4>
							<p>we live in the age of instant gratification, we expect a lot from our nail polish. For starters,                            nail color choice is of the utmost importance: the nail color has to speak to you, be in season and                            fit the event you're attending. Beyond that, the nail polish has to offer a good value (read:                            long-lasting and not too expensive) and look on your nails the same way it looks in the bottle. Plus,                            since we're always looking for ways to slice time off our beauty routines.

							<h4>Lip Stick</h4>
							<p>Since the dawn of prehistoric times, humans always had the need to distinguish themselves among                               others. Clothes, shoes, tools, jewelry and cosmetics were first of the ways we managed to do that,                               but lipsticks and facial pants were one of the most noticeable ways to change our appearance.                               Hunters painted their skin to better blend in with their surroundings, and young people used every                               way imaginable to make them more pretty and presentable to the opposite sex.

							<h4>Lips</h4>
                            
							<p>We kiss with them, we sip with them, we angle them with finesse to create coy little smiles --                             they're one of the sexiest parts of the body, and paired with the right gloss, balm, stick or stain,                             can make an onlooker weak at the knees.

                         We want it all when it comes to beauty products for the lips: color, shine, staying power, plumpness and                         an affordable price. The good news is we can have it all. There are a ton of lip products out there, but                         there's nothing classier or more seductive than the market's best lipsticks.

							<h4>Pankake</h4>
							<p>Cold weather and a lower UV index is your skin's best friend when it comes to getting beauty                              procedures done. Low temperature and shorter colder days prevent post inflammatory hyperpigmentation                             (like the dark brown or pink marks left over after having an acne break out), which can be further                              worsened by sun exposure. But let's be honest, it's also easier to recover discretely during                                hibernation season. Here, the best laser treatments to try this .Our readers tried and tested many                              pankake</p>
